Project Title: Brain Synapse Diversity
Authors: Adam Li, Tyler Tomita, Vijay Sadashivaiah

Opportunity:
With immunohistochemical multiplexing capabilities of array tomography (ATomo), people are now able to create datasets with high resolution voxel images of neuronal systems. The measurement is done with an immunohistochemistry assay and quantities measured with fluorescence microscopy. ATomo is well suited for proteomic mapping of synaptic circuits. With ultrathin sectioning of tissue samples, high-resolution imaging and computational reconstruction into image volumes, we now have the enhanced capabilities of understanding different synapse subset roles. We are able to determine this by the different levels and amounts of protein expression in synapses. This can be used to answer a major question in neuroscience of subsets of synaptic connections in neural circuits.

Feasibility:


Innovation:
If successful, this solution can improve understanding of neural mechanisms at a molecular level. By understanding the diversity of synapses within the brain, we can develop a better understanding of the anatomical structures within the brain. We would potentially look into how different types, concentrations and configurations of synapses affect memory, learning and motor control.
