Project Title: Brain Synapse Diversity

Significance:
Until early 1950s, the brain was considered to be a single cell performing all the operations. But it happens to be a collection of billions of neurons and a several hundred billion synapses. But synapses themselves are diverse in their morphology and genetics. This raises an important question of how this diversity indluences the behaviour and memory. When neuroscientists realized that the brain has a diverse set of neurons (For eg. Pyramidal, anaxonic, Purkinje etc.), this led to a lot of new studies and exciting results. Similarly different protien expressing synapse might be involved in different plasticity and functionality. Using the data from the array tomography with a sub synapse resolution will help to study how location and connectivity influence different cluster of synapses. Also the different molecular mechanisms involved in synapses will answer the undelying questions in behavioural and cognitive neurosciences.
