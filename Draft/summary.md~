Project Title: Brain Synapse Diversity
Authors: Adam Li, Tyler Tomita, Vijay Sadashivaiah

Opportunity:
With immunohistochemical multiplexing capabilities of array tomography (ATomo), people are now able to create datasets with high resolution voxel images of neuronal systems. The measurement is done with an immunohistochemistry assay and quantities measured with fluorescence microscopy. ATomo is well suited for proteomic mapping of synaptic circuits. With ultrathin sectioning of tissue samples, high-resolution imaging and computational reconstruction into image volumes, we now have the enhanced capabilities of understanding different synapse subset roles. We are able to determine this by the different levels and amounts of protein expression in synapses. This can be used to answer a major question in neuroscience of subsets of synaptic connections in neural circuits. 

Significance:
Until early 1950s, the brain was considered to be a single cell performing all the operations. But it happens to be a collection of billions of neurons and a several hundred billion synapses. But synapses themselves are diverse in their morphology and genetics. This raises an important question of how this diversity influences the behavior and memory. When neuroscientists realized that the brain has a diverse set of neurons (For e.g. Pyramidal, anaxonic, Purkinje etc.), this led to a lot of new studies and exciting results. Similarly, different protein expressing synapse might be involved in different plasticity and functionality. Using the data from the array tomography with a sub synapse resolution will help to study how location and connectivity influence different cluster of synapses. Also the different molecular mechanisms involved in synapses will answer the underlying questions in behavioral and cognitive neurosciences.
   

Feasibility:


Innovation:
If successful, this solution can improve understanding of neural mechanisms at a molecular level. By understanding the diversity of synapses within the brain, we can develop a better understanding of the anatomical structures within the brain. We would potentially look into how different types, concentrations and configurations of synapses affect memory, learning and motor control.
