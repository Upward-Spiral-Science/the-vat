Questions About my Project

We have a text file with a D = 1,119,299 data points on synapses located in 3D space. Each data point has a corresponding space vector of (x,y,z) coordinates and also feature vectors with 144 elements in each vector. 

D = 1,119,299 data points 
Each data point contains V = (x,y,z)
Each data point contains A = 144 features.

Descriptive 

1. What does each A_i stand for?
2. Does A_i contain any inf/NaN values?
3. Does D have any duplicate points?


Exploratory 
1. What is the mean and variance of V?
2. What is the PCA analysis of A downsampled?
3. what is the min of V in (x,y,z) direction and max?

Inferential 
Depends on answers above...

Predictive 
What is the best block model to cluster the data better? Can we use stochastic block modelling?

Causal 
1. Does a certain protein cause certain synapse subcluster?

Mechanistic 
1. What mechanism causes synaptic diversion within neuronal growth?
